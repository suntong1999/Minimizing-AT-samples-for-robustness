# Minimizing-AT-samples-for-robustness
This repository contains the source code of "Minimizing Adversarial Training Samples for Robust Image Classifiers: Analysis and adversarial example Generator Design".

## Contents

The repository consists of the following:
  - `adversarial_train.py`: Code for adversarial training in the method.
  - `test_acc.py`: Code for performing predictions using the ARF method.
  - `generate_and_test.py`: Code for adversarial attack.
  - 'new_gan/model/wgan_C_gan.py': Code for new GAN network.
  - 'new_gan/train.py': Code for training new GAN.

## Usage

To use the ARF method and comparison methods, follow the instructions below:

1. Navigate to the `Minimizing-AT-samples-for-robustness/` directory.
2. Run `adversarial_train.py` to implement adversarial training.
3. Use `test_acc.py` to perform predictions using the ARF method.
4. Use 'new_gan/train.py' to implement GAN training.
